        <h1>Divided by Eastern Parkway: How the 2024  Election Split Crown Heights</h1>

        <h2>By Adelina Romero. </h2>

        <p style="font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">
        Hasidic Orthodox Jewish voters in Southern Crown Heights shifted toward Trump in the 2024 Election, while Northern Crown Heights voters stayed firmly Democratic. What's behind this divide?
    </p>

        <p>Seated outside 770 Eastern Parkway, the global headquarters of the Chabad-Lubavitch Hasidic movement, Karen Kupe shook her head, her voice dropping to a near whisper. “It was understood that we were all voting for Trump,” she said. “The Jewish people who voted for Harris wouldn’t have said it out loud here.”</p>

        <p>Kupe’s words captured the atmosphere within Southern Crown Heights, Brooklyn during the 2024 election.Just across Eastern Parkway, Northern Crown Heights held firm in Democratic support, showing a growing political divide in the heart of Brooklyn.</p>

        <p>The election result maps by the <a href="https://www.electionatlas.nyc/maps.html" target="_blank">CUNY Graduate Center</a> show election districts within Assembly District 43 during the 2020 and 2024 presidential elections, providing a clear image of shifting voter patterns. Across seven election districts within Southern Crown Heights, Democrats saw significant voting percentage drops, from a 6-point decline in ED28 to a 20-point drop in ED20. Meanwhile, Trump made significant gains with voters, particularly in ED20 with gains of 153 votes and in ED43 with 120 votes.</p>

</p>
        <p>To better understand these figures, John Mollenkopf, a professor of political science and sociology at the CUNY Graduate Center, <a href="https://ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/inside-city-hall/2024/11/08/cuny-professor-breaks-down-trump-s-gains-in-new-york" target="_blank">spoke to Spectrum News NY 1 </a> about the shifting voter patterns within communities across New York City. </p>

        <p>“These neighborhoods have gone through a lot of stress since COVID started in 2020… These are low-income, immigrant communities, very sensitive to rising costs of living,” Mollenkopf explained.</p>

        <p>Mollenkopf spoke about how the needs of Orthodox Jewish communities, like Crown Heights, are often overlooked by political campaigns. "Many campaigns focus on prime voters, and immigrant communities don’t have nearly as many prime voters as settled, better-educated communities", he explained."There’s a little inattention that goes to some of these communities politically.” </p>

        <h3>The Role of Voter Outreach</h3>
        <p>However, Targeted voter outreach efforts by community members in South Crown Heights<a href="https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/news/articles/jewish-vote-elections-2024" target="_blank">particularly by organizers of the Jewish Future Alliance (JFA)</a>  did improve voter engagement efforts in the election. Canvassers distributed flyers and postcards saying, “Antisemitism is on the ballot, October 7th is on the ballot,” and began a social media campaign on X under the hashtag #DoItForTheShchuna to urge Jewish residents to head to the ballot box in record numbers.</p>

        <p>“Things felt better when Trump was in office,” said Karen Kupe, 62. “The economy was good, he was supporting Israel, and the neighborhood felt safe…we gave [Biden] a chance and look what we got. We’re being targeted and taken for granted,” she said with disdain.</p>

        <h3>A Different Story in Northern Crown Heights</h3>
        <p>While Southern Crown Heights voters swung significantly toward Trump, the story across Eastern Parkway in Northern Crown Heights was remarkably different, where enthusiastic support for Harris remained steadfast.</p>

        <p>Jessica Knight, a hair salon owner working in North Crown Heights for the past five years, described the optimism that defined her part of the neighborhood leading up to the election. “We were so excited for Kamala. People were out campaigning for her, expecting real change in the country,” she said.</p>

        <p>“Now my clients—immigration attorneys, nonprofit workers, and abortion rights advocates—are worried and preparing for what’s coming in a second Trump administration,” Knight said. “I now walk outside with anxiety, wondering, Who can I trust?”</p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>Walking along Eastern Parkway, the atmosphere of Crown Heights reflects the political realities across the country, a nation yearning for change. The 2024 election results provide more than a visual geographic divide—it portrays a neighborhood split on what changes are needed to make Crown Heights safer.</p>

        <p>As the dust settles, one question remains unanswered: Will Eastern Parkway remain a symbol of political division in Crown Heights, or can it become a bridge? The answer may hold lessons not only for Crown Heights but for the future of the nation.</p>
